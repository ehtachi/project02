## My process

Used flexbox and divided it into containers, should have made better use of the containers because I ended up with a gap between the flex items. Will try to not get that problem in my nextx project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The importance of min-height and min-width, also that rem is pretty useful.
